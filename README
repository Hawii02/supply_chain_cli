# Supply Chain_cli Project
My project entails a database which has a Customer table and a Supplier table and is joined in a one to many relationship by a PRIMARY KEY which is supplier id, it joins both Customer table and Supplier table where Supplier id is the FOREIGN KEY to Customer table. It also contains a CLI for a customer to find a supplier, find a product by name and list all suppliers.

# Supplier Table
The supplier table has the following Columns:
supplier id, supplier name, supplier contact, supplier location, product.
The supplier table contains their details in the database and all a customer would need to know to connect with them if they want a particular product.


# Customer Table
The customer table has the following Columns:
customer name, customer contact, customer location, supplier id.
The purpose of this table is for the supplier to know and plan out with the customer by accessing their details to carry out sales.
A supplier can also delete a customer from database and can also create or add a customer to database to connect with them directly and also to know which products they are looking for.

# CLI
What entails on my menu:
1. To find a supplier it has a function which is stored in the helpers function
2. To find a product- it ideally displays the products which match the name which is inputed in the command line
3. To delete a customer it deletes the customers details from the database
4. To add a customer it adds the customer to the database together with name, location and contact.
5. List all suppliers it lists all suppliers in the database
6. Exit the application it exits from the menu
